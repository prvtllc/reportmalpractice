##From the original report:

Detectives from the Prince William-Manassas-Manassas Park Narcotics Task Force, with the help from the Virginia Attorney Generalâ€™s Office and the FBI, executed multiple search warrants at Sunnyview Neurology at 8609 Sudley Road in Manassas and at a home in Herndon.

The investigation was initiated by the regional task force in November of 2015.

Police say an investigation revealed that the physician at the practice, Ishtiaq Ahmad, gave prescriptions and pain medications without properly performing necessary medical exams.

Ahmed is charged with three counts of obtaining drugs by fraud, three counts of manufacturing or selling a controlled substance, three counts of false statement represented in medical assistance and three counts of obtaining money by false pretenses.

He is being held at the Prince William-Manassas Regional Adult Detention Center and is scheduled to appear in Prince William County General District Court August 18.

At the beginning of the investigation, detectives say they gave an informational presentation to Ahmad about the statutory requirements for prescribing controlled substances, as well as current methods used by pill seekers. 

The information focused on tactics of deception, offenses of the Virginia Code and additional information about addiction to prescription pills and heroin. 

Throughout 2016, the investigation continued and Ahmad did not alter his practices, continuing to provide pain medications without properly performing the necessary medical exams, police say.

Any patient of Sunnyview Neurology who would like to talk with a detective can call 703-686-6522.
