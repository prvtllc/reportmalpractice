The Virginia Board of Medicine (“Board”) and Adegbenga Adetokunbo Bankole, M.D., as evidenced by their signatures hereto, in lieu of proceeding to an informal conference, enter into the following Consent Order affecting Dr. Bankole’s license to practice medicine and surgery in the Commonwealth of Virginia.
FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
1.	Adegbenga Adetokunbo Bankole, M.D., was issued License Number 0101-245177 to practice medicine and surgery on March 6,2009, which is scheduled to expire on October 31,2020.
2.	Dr. Bankole violated Virginia Code § 54.1-2915(A)(12), (13), (16), (18), and (19) and 18 VAC 85-20-100(A) of the Regulations Governing the Practice of Medicine, Osteopathic Medicine, Podiatry, and Chiropractic in that he engaged in conduct with Patient A during the course of the practitioner-patient relationship that a reasonable patient would consider lewd or offensive. Specifically:
a.	At an appointment on November 22, 2014, Dr. Bankole hugged Patient A at the end of the appointment, telling her she was his “favorite patient”. Patient A described the hug as tight and that she did not like that Dr. Bankole was “in her space”. She had been seeing Dr. Bankole periodically since November 17,2013.
b.	At Patient A’s next appointment on February 25,2016, Dr. Bankole again hugged Patient A at the end of the appointment, and kissed her on her forehead.
c.	On November 3,2015, at the end of Patient A’s appointment, Dr. Bankole hugged her and told her that she was his favorite patient, and that he looked forward to when she would come in. Following this appointment, Patient A told her pain management doctor about Dr. Bankole’s conduct.
d.	At the conclusion of Patient A’s next appointment, on January 29, 2016, Dr. Bankole again hugged Patient A. Patient A stated that Dr. Bankole continued to hold her tighter, squeezed her buttocks, and kissed her. Patient A left her appointment without checking out, and did not return to Dr. Bankole’s office again.
e.	Patient A told her primary care physician what had occurred, and asked for a referral to a different rheumatologist because she refused to go back to Dr. Bankole. The primary care physician’s office manager assisted Patient A in reporting Dr. Bankole’s behavior to hospital Risk Management. Patient A also reported Dr. Bankole’s conduct to her gynecologist.
3.	Following Patient A’s complaints of the above conduct to hospital Risk Management, Dr. Bankole’s employer, took the following steps:
a.	Dr. Bankole is required, indefinitely, to have a chaperone for “all interactions with female patients that involve a touching, either directly or through an instrument, of an intimate body part.”
b.	Dr. Bankole was required to have a formal evaluation of his ability to practice
professionally.
c.	Dr. Bankole was required to take a continuing medical education course titled, Medical Ethics, Boundaries, and Professionalism.
4.	Dr. Bankole underwent a comprehensive multidisciplinary evaluation at Professional Renewal Center from March 3 through March 7, 2017, as required by his employer. Dr. Bankole’s evaluation revealed the following: 
a. - d. See Confidential Exhibit
e.	At the conclusion of his program, Dr. Bankole reported “an increased understanding of the need to establish and maintain appropriate professional boundaries.” Further, the Professional Renewal Center found that Dr. Bankole is not a sexual predator and that, “his behavioral difficulties were best seen in terms of cultural issues as well as his desire to form positive relationships with patients that he believed would be enhanced through being overly familiar.”
f.	It was the opinion of the Professional Renewal Center that Dr. Bankole was fit to practice medicine.
